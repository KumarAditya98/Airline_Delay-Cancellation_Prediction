Importing data
```{r}
airlines <- read.csv("data/airlines.csv")
airports <- read.csv("data/airports.csv")
# flights <- read.csv("data/flights.csv")
```

Subsetting dataset because it is very large
```{r}
# set.seed(333)
# flight_sample <- sample(2, nrow(flights), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.9))
# flights_small <- flights[flight_sample==1, ]
# head(flights_small)
```

Exporting smaller sample
```{r}
# write.csv(flights_small, file = "data/flights_small.csv")

flight_data <- read.csv("data/flights_small.csv")
```
